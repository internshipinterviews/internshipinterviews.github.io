Here you will learn something most people don't focus on: how to actually get the job. Techical skills from the other two courses are just the start. Getting a job is 2 steps: get interviews, pass interviews. This course will talk about getting interviews as well as passing nontechnical interviews. 

We will cover resume design and critiques, common behavioral interview topics and mistakes, the best way to apply for jobs, the referral process, what to do if you can't answer a technical quesetion, how to build a code portfolio that gets interviews, workplace networking, optimized linkedin profile design, and more.
