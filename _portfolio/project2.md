Here we will build on what was learned in the intro DS/A course and cover more advanced topics. The goal is for you to be able to solve a leetcode medium problem you haven't seen before in 30-45 minutes, which is typically enough to land jobs at FAANG or top Unicorn startups (like Uber, Doordash, etc). After completion, you will be able to pass interviews for high paying tech jobs. Unlike the first course, this one focuses more on problem solving and applying data structures you know to tougher problems. We will also cover tougher content like topological sorting, greedy algorithms, and more complex dynamic programming. In class we will do live solving of problems, and then assign homework of twists upon that question. These will be similar to mock interview questions, and we will have a way for you to sign up to mock interview with other students in the class. 


Topics: 
- common interview problems 
- tougher problems from the areas in intro to DS/A (leetcode problem examples: zigzag traveral of binary tree, merge intervals, letter combinations of phone interviews, 3 sum, number of islands, course scheduling, etc)
